Scripting
This is only one example of how we can automate tasks through scripting. This example is for nmap:

nmapScript.JPG

Line 1: this is the nmap command using the SYN scan (-sS) options, scanning the whole subnet range of IP addresses (192.168.1.0/24). It is scanning for port 53, and sends the output (-oG) to a grep-able file named "dn".

Line 2: takes the results of line 1 and searches (greps) for the word "open" and saves the results in the file named dn1

Line 3: takes line 2 results and removes extraneous information leaving just the IP Addresses of the servers with port 53 open. Outputs the results to the file named dn53.

Lines 4-6: loops through the dn53 with another nmap command to find service/version information (-sV).
